# LangChain: Pdf-Parser-GUI

Hi Folks,


Welcome to my learning journey! This is my first repository for a PDF parser based on LLMs. I enjoy reading research papers and learning new findings. However, it can be tedious to scan through pages of text to find the key information (A Personal ChatBot). That's why I decided to build something that would provide me with concise information. Please like and comment on my work!!
